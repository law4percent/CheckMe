# Teacher’s Manual: Preparing Test Papers for Automated Grading System

## 1. Purpose

This manual guides teachers to prepare test papers in a format that allows our AI-based system to **accurately read and grade student answers,** including multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, student identification, and enumeration questions.


## 2. General Rules

**1. Provide Student ID Field**

- At the top of the sheet, include a blank field labeled:
```
    Student ID: __________
```

- Students must write their ID clearly.

- This is mandatory for the system to identify the student in the database.


**2. Include Clear Instructions**

- Always provide instructions for each section at the top.

- Examples:
```
    - “Circle the correct letter for each multiple-choice question.”

    - “Write the correct answer in the blank space.”
```

**3. Consistent Question Numbering**

- Number questions continuously across sections.

- Example:
```
    Section I: Multiple Choice (Circle the correct answer)
    1, 2, 3, ...

    Section II: True or False (Fill in the blank)
    4, 5, 6, ...

    Section III: Multiple Choice (Fill in the blank)
    7, 8, ...

    Section IV: Enumeration (Fill in the blank)
    9, 10, ...
```

**4. Answer Format**

- Multiple-choice questions: Students circle A, B, C, or D.

- Fill-in-the-blank: Students write A, B, C, D, or text in the blank.

- Enumeration: Students fill in the blank for each item.

- Avoid combining multiple answers in the same space.



## 3. Layout Guidelines
| Item |	Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Student ID | Blank at the top, labeled clearly |
| Instructions | Provide before each section |
| Question Numbers | Continuous numbering across sections |
| Answer Style | Multiple-choice: circle; Fill-in-the-blank or Enumeration: write letter/text |
| Sections | Clearly labeled (Section I, II, III, IV, etc.) |
| Answer Key Reference | Keep answer key separate, with matching question numbers |

## 4. Example Test Paper Layout
```
Student ID: __________

Section I: Multiple Choice (Circle the correct answer)
1. What is a periodic interrupt?
   a) An interrupt that occurs randomly
   b) An interrupt triggered at fixed intervals
   c) An interrupt caused by a software error
   d) An interrupt generated by polling

2. Which of the following is an example of a hardware interrupt?
   a) Divide-by-zero error
   b) Real-time clock tick
   c) Keyboard press
   d) Software subroutine call

Section II: True or False (Fill in the blank)
3. The CPU executes instructions in a __________ manner.
4. A timer interrupt occurs at __________ intervals.


Section III: Enumeration (Fill in the blank)
5. _CPU_ – Sometimes called the brain of the computer.
6. _RAM_ – Stores data temporarily.
```


## 5. Tips for Better AI Performance

- Use **dark pens or pencils** for answers to improve detection.

- Keep the **paper flat** and properly aligned when scanning or photographing.

- Avoid handwriting that overlaps letters or boxes.

- Provide **examples or sample answers** in the instructions if needed.

- Ensure the **teacher instructions** clearly indicate the answer style (circle, fill-in, enumeration).
